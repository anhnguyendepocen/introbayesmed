This online class will span over 3 consecutive Thursdays. This schedule is intended to give you enough time to complete.

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): this page contains the lecture notes and slides for this class
- [**Lectures**](/lectures/) (<i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i>): this page contains the recorded lecture videos
- [**Practicals**](/practicals/) (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains the practicals corresponding to the topics covered each of the 3 days.

On both *Tuesday June 16 evening* and *Tuesday June 23 evening*, I ask that you **send me your attempt at solving the practicals** by [email](mailto::boris.hejblum@u-bordeaux.fr). Thus, I will be able to assess your progress, and focus the live sessions on day 2 and day 3 on the potential difficulties you encountered previously.
