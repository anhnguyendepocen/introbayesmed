<h2>Course content</h2>
<p>Bayesian analysis is a statistical tool that is becoming increasingly popular in medical science. Notably, Bayesian approaches have become commonly used in adaptive designs for Phase I/II trials, in meta- analyses, and also in transcriptomics analysis. This course provides an introduction to Bayesian tools, with an emphasis on biostatistics applications, in order to familiarize students with such methods and their practical applications. Thanks to its rich modeling possibilities the Bayesian framework is appealing, especially when the number of observations is scarce. It can adaptively incorporate information as it becomes available, an important feature for early phase clinical trials. Thus, adaptive Bayesian designs for Phase I/II trials reduce the chances of unnecessarily exposing participants to inappropriate doses and have better decision-making properties compared to the standard rule-based dose-escalation designs. Besides, the use of a Bayesian approach is also very appealing in meta-analyses because of: i) the often relatively small number of studies available, ii) its flexibility, iii) and its better handling of heterogeneity from aggregated results, especially in network meta-analyses. Thanks to modern computing tools, practical Bayesian analysis has become relatively straightforward, which is contributing to its increasing popularity. JAGS is a flexible software interfaced with R, that allows to easily specify a Bayesian model and that automatically perform inference for posterior parameters distributions as well as graphic outputs to monitor the quality of the analysis.</p>
<p>The aim of the course is to provide insights into Bayesian statistics in the context of medical studies. We will cover the following topics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Bayesian modeling (prior, posterior, likelihood, Bayes theorem)</li>
<li>Bayesian estimation (Credibility Intervals, Maximum a Posteriori, Bayes factor)</li>
<li>Adaptive designs for Phase I/II trials</li>
<li>Bayesian meta-analyses</li>
<li>Practical Bayesian Analysis with <i class="fab  fa-r-project " style="color:#0085d6;"></i> and <code>JAGS</code> softwares</li>
<li>critical reading of medical publications.</li>
</ol>
<p>All concepts will be illustrated with real-life examples from the medical literature</p>

<div id="course-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Course objectives</h2>
<p>A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarize oneself with the <strong>Bayesian framework</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>understand and assess a Bayesian modeling strategy, and discuss its underlying assumptions</li>
<li>rigorously describe expert knowledge by a quantitative prior distribution</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Study and perform Bayesian analyses in <strong>biomedical applications</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>understand, discuss and reproduce a Bayesian (re-)estimation of a Relative Risk</li>
<li>perform a Bayesian regression using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/"><i class="fab  fa-r-project " style="color:#0085d6;"></i></a>, applied to meta-analysis</li>
<li>understand and explain an adaptive design for Phase I/II trials and the associated decision-rule</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<div id="targeted-audience" class="section level2">
<h2>Targeted audience</h2>
<p>This course is targeted towards medical students in graduate programms at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. To be able to follow this course, participants need both basic knowledge in statistics (most notably some familiarity with Maximum Likelihood Estimation) and basic knowledge in R (functional programming, vector allocation, linear regression).</p>
<p>Advanced mathematical training is not required as we will explain the methods on an elementary mathematical level. During the practicals on their laptop, the students will learn how to technically apply the Bayesian tools on real data, and should be able to perform a Bayesian regression by the end of the course. Note that several statistical software can be used for Bayesian analysis, however solutions will be provided for the statistical softwares <i class="fab  fa-r-project " style="color:#0085d6;"></i> and <code>JAGS</code> only (alternatives such as <a href="https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/"><code>WinBUGS</code></a> or <a href="https://mc-stan.org/"><code>STAN</code></a> will not be covered).</p>

<h3>R and RStudio</h3>
<p>The practicals in this class will use R extensively ! Please make sure you have an up-to-date working installation of R:</p>
<ul>
<li>latest version of <i class="fab  fa-r-project " style="color:#0085d6;"></i> (â‰¥ 4.0.0) ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a> (watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/203516510">here</a> how to install it)</li>
<li>latest version of RStudio (â‰¥ 1.3.959) ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not fluent in R yet, you can have a look at those various (free) ressources on R beforehand:</p>

<div id="jags-software" class="section level3">
<h3><code>JAGS</code> software</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>install the <code>JAGS</code> software from here ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/" class="uri">https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/</a></p></li>
<li><p>install the <code>rjags</code> package in <i class="fab  fa-r-project " style="color:#0085d6;"></i> by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;rjags&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>make sure it works by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rjags)</code></pre>
<p>If it <em>does</em> work correctly, you should get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: coda
## Linked to JAGS 4.3.0
## Loaded modules: basemod,bugs</code></pre></li>

<h2>Class chatroom</h2>
<p>I have setup a class chatroom on <a href="https://introbayesmed20.slack.com">Slack</a>. this space is intended so that we can have asynchronous communication, but also so that you (students) can communicate with one another.</p>
